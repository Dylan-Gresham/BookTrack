# Future Functionality

1. Fix Create Account route (styling, verification, input feedback, account creation guide).
2. Within the Library route, create a section for current reading progress
    - [x] Book name & author
    - [x] Current # of pages read
    - [x] \# of pages in the book
    - [x] Progress bar to show progress visually
    - [ ] Dropdown/button to allow modification of reading progress
3. Ability to add books to the library
    - Probably with an API like Google Books to automatically find books and their statistics based off the user's input
