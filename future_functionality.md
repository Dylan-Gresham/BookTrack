# Future Functionality

1. Fix Create Account route (styling, verification, input feedback, account creation guide).
2. Change the home page to a different page when a valid account is "signed in" (config file exists with a username and a database that exists and can be read from).
3. If a config file already exists with valid user info, open Booktrack to the "Library" route
