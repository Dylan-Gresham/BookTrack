# Future Functionality

1. Fix Create Account route (styling, verification, input feedback, account creation guide).
2. Change the home page to a different page when a valid account is "signed in" (config file exists with a username and a database that exists and can be read from).
4. If a config file already exists with valid user info, open Booktrack to the "Library" route
5. Create Library route which will show all books in the user's library (database)
6. Within the Library route, create a section for current reading progress
    - Book name & author
    - Current # of pages read
    - \# of pages in the book
    - Progress bar to show progress visually
    - Dropdown/button to allow modification of reading progress
7. Ability to add books to the library
    - Probably with an API like Google Books to automatically find books and their statistics based off the user's input
